A simple library for testing Steamodded Balatro mods, which I'm now realizing unambigiously should have been a mod itself and not a library. Uh, oops. :)

In particular, it works within the Balatro event system. Tests consist of multiple steps that only run once the game has resolved all events that resulted from the previous step. So, things like playing a hand and letting the hand resolve entirely before checking the score. Things like that.

It's written in [YueScript](https://yuescript.org/), a [MoonScript](https://moonscript.org/) flavor, because I think Lua is a bit verbose and stinky. But it compiles to Lua, so you don't have to switch. The example below is also written in YueScript, I hope it's still understandable!

It's integrated with DebugPlus. Use the command "test" to run all your tests. Here's some examples:

```lua
testing = assert(SMODS.load_file("libs\\steamodded_test\\main.lua"))()

G.steamodded_tests.tests[] = testing.TestBundle("Example tests", {

        testing.TestBundle("Basic tests", {
            testing.Test("Always passes", () -> true)
            testing.Test("Always fails", () -> false)
            testing.Test("Always confuses the tester", () -> nil)
            testing.Test("Always errors", () -> assert(false))
        }),

        testing.TestBundle("Main game tests", {

                testing.Test("Scoring an Ace", {
                    testing.create_state_steps(),
                    () -> testing.play_hand({"A"}),
                    () -> testing.assert_hand_scored(16)
                }),

                testing.Test("Scoring an Ace (overzealous)", {
                    testing.create_state_steps(),
                    () -> testing.play_hand({"A"}),
                    () -> testing.assert_hand_scored(99999)
                })
            
        })
    }
)
```


Then, in the DebugPlus console, you can do this:

```
> test
< here we go :)

```

I fully expect to make breaking changes. So y'know.
